Here are some projects I've done in the past.

<h3><a href="/projects/galaxy-simulator/">Galaxy Simulator</a></h3>

This is a small simulator I've made after learning Three.js. It generates some planets in the 3-D space randomly and simulates the gravity and inelastic collision between them, which equals a minimal physics engine.

</center>

I was impressed by the idea of Life Calendar in the passage [Your Life in Weeks](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html), and attempted to make a front-end implementation. This small application can record the things I've done everyday and the "meaningfulness" I assign to them, the details are recorded in the post [Life Calendar](../posts/life-calendar/).

This AST Visualizer is a by-product of Database Course Design, as I have already made a SQL parser. The input is SQL statements, and output is the abstract syntax tree of it. The Viz.js is used for drawing, which is Graphviz compiled to front-end.
